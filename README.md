# PharTracker ![](https://img.shields.io/github/package-json/v/thephar/phartracker) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/ThePhar/phartracker.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/ThePhar/phartracker) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/ThePhar/phartracker/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/ThePhar/phartracker?branch=master)

An item tracker for **The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time Randomizer**, inspired by **EmoTracker**.

( This is where an image will go when I have something to show. Just use your imagination. ðŸ˜‰ )

## Current Features
- ~~A sweet looking README file.~~ 

I'm currently rewriting my old code, so bare with me. I'll add new features ASAP.

## Planned Features
- Automated tracking of items via a custom **Bizhawk** lua script.*
- Ability to share real-time tracking of items via the internet.
- Monitor multiple item trackers for multi-world randomizers.
- Set custom image packs for all items.
- View available checks via the application or direct drawn on **Bizhawk**.

_*Manual item tracking will be supported as well._

## Why though?
Because I can and thought this would be a fun project to create and get some experience
developing **Electron** applications with **React** in **TypeScript**. Plus I get to learn some
lua scripting! _<small>("Why do arrays start at 1?")</small>_
